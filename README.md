# Named-entity-recognisation-in-a-query
Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying named entities in search text and classifying them into predefined categories. 
Very important applications of Named Entity Recognition (NER) are Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Question Answering, Machine Translation, POS Tagging, Text Mining and Automatic Summarization etc.
I have address the problem of automatically detecting and classifying keywords in natural language search queries. 
In the task given a query, we are to detect the named entity within the query and identify the most likely classes of the named entity. 
Classes of named entities can be, for instance, “Book”, “Movie”, “Game”, and “Music”. 
For example in the query “the song beat it by michael jackson”, two named entities should be detected, namely “michael jackson” being identified as an person and “beat it” identified as a Music. 
The problem will be addressed by evaluating known techniques for NERQ on natural language queries from the domain. 
Using NER for queries is, however, acknowledged to be a challenging task due to queries being short, ungrammatical and containing minimal linguistic context
This is the implementation of a research paper to produce efficient results
